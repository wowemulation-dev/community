## 🌟 What We're All About

We're a community dedicated to preserving the magic of World of Warcraft versions
1.x through 5.x (all the MPQ-based versions). Think of us as digital archaeologists,
keeping these classic versions alive for future generations to study, enjoy, and
learn from. We're not here to compete with Blizzard's Classic WoW – we're here
because we love the technical challenge and the nostalgia!

Founded in August 2023, our community has grown into a warm, welcoming space where
everyone from complete beginners to seasoned developers can share their passion
for WoW emulation.
